# PYRO HEAT BALANCE PROJECT

This web application helps with the process of Pyro Heat Balance which is widely employed in Cement Industries to carry out Energy Audits. The optimum priority of the modern cement production industry is the minimization of heat energy loss for effective heat utilization. Heat balance can offer extremely useful information on the thermal performance of the system. This is achieved by employing the second law of thermodynamics.

The Web App was built in Python using the following libraries:
1. json
2. requests
3. mpmath
4. numpy
5. pandas
6. seaborn
7. scipy
8. streamlit
9. streamlit-aggrid
10. matplotlib
11. streamlit-lottie
12. streamlit-option-menu
13. annotated-text

In case you have any queries regarding the functionality of the Web Application, you can refer to the following YouTube video for a Demo:
