# HeatBalanceProject
The deployed web application is live at:  
This web application helps with the process of Pyro Heat Balance which is widely employed in Cement Industries to carry out Energy Audits. The optimum priority of the modern cement production industry is the minimization of heat energy loss for effective heat utilization. Heat balance can offer extremely useful information on the thermal performance of the system. This is achieved by employing the second law of thermodynamics.

The Web App was built in Python using the following libraries:
1. json
2. requests
3. mpmath
4. numpy
5. pandas
6. seaborn
7. scipy
8. streamlit
9. streamlit-aggrid
10. matplotlib
11. streamlit-lottie
12. streamlit-option-menu
